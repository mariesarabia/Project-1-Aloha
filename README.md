# Project1-Aloha

For my very first project at Red Academy, I created the homepage of an ecommerce website for the Aloha Apparel Co., using HTML and CSS, with interactivity using JavaScript. A mobile-first approach was implemented, and responsive layout was created using the Flexbox method, optimized for three required screen sizes: mobile, tablet (600px) and desktop (1240px). 

This was also my first taste of version control using Git and the creation and maintenance of a repository on GitHub. 

## TECHNOLOGIES USED:

* HTML
* CSS 
* Javascript
* JQuery

## LEARNINGS: 
Through this project I learned the following: 
### Git/GitHub
* Proper creation and maintenance of root directory
* Initializing a Git repository in the root directory 
* Pushing to GitHub, syncing commits

### HTML 
* Creating the html mark-up based on designer-provided comps
* Using the HTML 5 doctype and semantic HTML5 markup

### CSS
* Use of CSS properties to style text and layout
* The appropriate use of html elements, and classes and IDs as selectors
* Using a list-based navigation menu
* Using the background property to create a hero image with 3 layers and for use in image gallery

### Mobile-First Approach and Responsive Design
* Implementing a mobile-first approach to designing the website 
* Creating a responsive layout using the flexbox method and positioning elements using flex-box properties instead of the use of floats
* Optimizing for 3 screen sizes (mobile, tablet and desktop)
* The use of rem and em in sizing 

### JavaScript
* Incorporating smooth scrolling using JS 
* The use of an image carousel using a jQuery plugin 

### Others 
* Use of custom fonts using @font-face 
* Use of icon-font 
* Cross-browser testing Chrome, Firefox, Safari (flexbox gallery not working properly on Firefox and Safari)
